Aloha!

My name is Sean Morris and I am a Junior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am getting a bachelors in Managment of Information Systems at Shidler's college of Business. I choose MIS because I wanted to utilize technology while learning how a business works at the same time.

Some of my hobbies include surfing, traveling, and eating delicious food. My favorite spots to surf are in Waikiki and near Ala Moana bowls. I have recently been to Japan and Colorado. Some of my favorite food on the island would have to be ramen.
